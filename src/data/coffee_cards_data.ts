    description:
      "Espresso is a concentrated form of coffee that’s brewed by forcing nearly boiling water through finely-ground coffee beans under high pressure. It produces a thick, rich, and aromatic shot of coffee with a layer of golden crema on top. The flavor is bold and intense, with deep roasted notes and a pleasant bitterness that coffee lovers appreciate. Espresso is also the base for many other drinks like cappuccinos, lattes, and macchiatos, making it the heart of most coffee shops.",

    description:
      "Cappuccino is a classic Italian coffee drink known for its perfect balance of espresso, steamed milk, and foamed milk. The drink has a velvety texture and a creamy taste that blends the strength of coffee with the smoothness of milk. Often topped with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon, cappuccinos are both visually appealing and delicious. It’s an ideal choice for mornings or coffee breaks, offering comfort in every sip.",

    description:
      "A latte is a smooth and creamy coffee beverage made from espresso and steamed milk, topped with a light layer of foam. It has a mild flavor, making it a great choice for those who prefer a less bitter coffee experience. Lattes are often customized with flavored syrups like vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut, and baristas frequently create beautiful latte art on top. It’s a perfect drink to enjoy slowly while reading, working, or relaxing.",

    title: "Cold Brew",
    description:
      "Cold brew coffee is made by steeping coarsely ground coffee beans in cold water for 12 to 24 hours. This slow extraction process produces a smooth, rich, and slightly sweet coffee with lower acidity compared to hot-brewed methods. Served chilled over ice, it’s refreshing and energizing, especially on warm days. Cold brew can be enjoyed black for a pure taste or with milk for a creamy, balanced flavor.",
